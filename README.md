## Tools Used - 
PowerBI

## Business Questions
1. Which drug categories are driving the majority of the sales?
2. What is the sales trend over the years?
3. Which months and quarters are the best and worst in sales performance?
4. What are actual monthly sales in comparison to expected sales?
5. What are the total sales revenue on weekly and daily basis?
6. What are the underperforming months and drug categories?

## KPIs -
1. Weekly Sales Contribution by N02BE drug
2. Highest Count of Drug sold on Hourly Basis
3. Total Monthly Sales
4. Average Monthly Sales

## Steps - 
1. Data Cleaning - used power query to clean & transform the data
2. Data Modelling - connected tables in a data model
3. Creating Measures - creating measures using formulas to use for analysis and visualization (for example - weekly sales contribution by N02BE - [Total weekly sales/Weekly sales of N02BE]*100)
4. Creating Dashboard for Visualization

## Key Points of Visualizations -
1. Weekly sales by category - sales of each category of drug according to each week (week 1 to 6)
2. Total Monthly sales vs Average Monthly Sales - comparing actual Total sales in each month and calculated average sales each month
3. Yearly Sales by Category
4. Daily Sales by Category
5. Quantity of Each Category Sold Hourly - quantity of each drug sold on hourly basis
6. Quaterly vs Total Monthly Sales by Category - comparing quarterly sales and total monthly sales of each drug category

## Conclusions
Take a detailed look at the dashboard to infer the results of the analysis.
1. N02BE drug is the top performer with 49.38% weekly sales contribution.
2. Sales trend has seen an incline from 2014 to 2016 with peak at 2016. Then there is a decline in 2017 and partial recovery in 2018 and a steady decline in 2019.
3. Best Month: October (~$11k each), Worst Month: July & August (~9K each)<br>
   Best Quarter: Q1 & Q3, Worst Quarter: Q2
4. Average monthly sales is $15.82k but actual monthly sales are far less. Most months are underperforming.

## Recommendations -

2. Study the events on high performing months and try to replicate them for underperforming months to boost sales.
3. Leverage high performing hours for promotions and discounts to increase sales performance.
4. Set realistic monthly sales targets according to historical data.
5. Optimize inventory & supply chain on underperforming drug categories.
